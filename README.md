# A review of machine learning models for the prediction of sepsis in Canadian healthcare systems

### Abstract

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that is responsible for a significant number of deaths and healthcare costs in Canada. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, but diagnosing sepsis remains challenging due to its varied symptoms. Traditional diagnostic tools, such as SIRS, SOFA, and MEWS, have limitations in accuracy and timeliness. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have shown promise in predicting sepsis earlier, using electronic health record data. This paper reviews several machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and deep neural networks, highlighting their effectiveness in sepsis prediction. While these AI models outperform traditional methods in clinical trials, their current potential for implementation in Canada is limited. The review explores the challenges of adopting these technologies in Canadian healthcare, such as data diversity, interpretability, and the need to reduce false positives. We highlight strategies to integrate AI models into Canadaâ€™s healthcare system to reduce the impact of sepsis on patient mortality and improve healthcare costs.
